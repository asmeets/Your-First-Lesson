  After adding a new page, you’ll see our **WYSIWYG editor** on the right. It
  lets you type and format text just like you would in a word processor, with
  buttons for:


  * **Bold** and *Italic* text

  * **Strikethrough**

  * **Blockquotes**

  * **Inline Code** or code blocks

  * **Images**

  * **Numbered** and **bulleted** lists


  Feel free to highlight key concepts, embed code snippets, or insert
  screenshots and diagrams for extra clarity.&#x20;


  Because we’re in **Beta**, we appreciate any feedback on your editing
  experience—just click **“Give Feedback”** or join our Community discussions to
  let us know what’s working well or could be improved!
