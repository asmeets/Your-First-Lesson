  This lesson template is here to help you get started creating lessons in VS
  Code for Education.


  * This panel is where you’ll find our built‐in WYSIWYG content editor, where
  you can type, copy/paste, format text, and even embed code snippets or images.

  * To the left of the content editor, you can toggle which parts of the
  interface learners will have access to - a terminal, a code editor, and file
  explorer. By default, learners will be able to see your lesson content.


  Lesson authoring is currently in Beta, which means we’re actively developing
  and improving these features. We’d love to hear your thoughts—please click
  “Give Feedback” or join our Community discussion to share ideas, report
  issues, and help shape the future of VS Code for Education.


  **Happy authoring!**
