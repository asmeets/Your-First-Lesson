title: Add a lesson page
duration: 5
content: >
  To get started, your lesson can have as many pages as you need. To add a new one, simply select the + icon next to your lesson title in the Table of Contents in the far left panel (for example, in “Tutorial: Welcome to Authoring”). You'll be asked to provide a title for the lesson page.



After creating the new page, you can:

Set the Title to help learners navigate your lesson.

Adjust Page Settings (show or hide Content, Terminal, Editor, and Explorer) to control how students interact with the material.

Add Text, Code, or Other Resources in the WYSIWYG editor on the right.

We would love your feedback. If something isn’t working as expected or if you have an idea for improvement, click “Give Feedback” or join our Community discussion.
