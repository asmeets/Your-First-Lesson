title: Adding a lesson page
duration: 5
content: >
  Each lesson page in VS Code for Education can be tailored to fit your teaching
  needs. Whether you want to provide a read‐only reference or an interactive
  coding environment, these options help you decide how students will engage
  with the material. Using the "Lesson Page Settings" tab, you can set:


  * **Title**: Change how this page is labeled in your lesson.

  * **Duration (in minutes)**: Let learners know how much time they might spend
  here.

  * **Show Content**: Toggle whether the page’s written text is visible.

  * **Show Terminal**: Turn on a built‐in terminal so students can run commands
  or code.

  * **Show Editor**: Allow learners to directly edit code or text on this page.

  * **Show Explorer**: Give learners access to the file explorer to view and
  manage lesson files.


  Feel free to experiment with these settings - your changes are immediate, so
  you can see how each option affects the learning experience. As always, we’re
  in Beta, so if you spot something unexpected or have ideas to improve, please
  click **“Give Feedback”** or visit our Community discussions.
